# Adult-Income-Analysis

The dataset I used for this analysis is the Adult Income Dataset where you have 15 attributes such as age, education level, marital status, line of work and more. The target variable is income where the values of that attribute is whether this person made less than 50K or more than 50K annual income. The objective of this analysis is to predict of someone makes over 50K or less than 50K annually, given the attributes from the dataset. I used four different machine learning algorithms and compared them all to see which gave me the best performance (accuracy rate). I also provided some exploratory data analysis with this notebook. Lastly, I also use K-Fold Cross Validation to optimize the accuracy rate for each model.
